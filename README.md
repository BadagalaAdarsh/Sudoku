# Sudoku

* There is a CNN based model in the program which is helpful in recognising the digits in the sudoku grid
* After recognizing the digits they are given input to other program in the form of matrix
* That program solves the sudoku puzzle and gives its output to opencv which again shows us the solution to the puzzle on the screen in realtime
